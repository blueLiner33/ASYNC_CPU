;;; Stub functions for DLX traps.
;;;
;;; Ethan L. Miller, 1999.  Released to the public domain.
;;;
;;; There are two exit traps.  The first, _exitsim, actually exits the
;;; simulator.  The second, _exit, simply calls a regular trap in the
;;; DLX simulator, and would be suitable for a user program that wants
;;; to signal the OS that it's exiting.
;;;
;;; IMPORTANT: all code that's run "native" on the simulator - OS code and
;;; programs run without an OS - should call exitsim() rather than just
;;; falling through to exit.
