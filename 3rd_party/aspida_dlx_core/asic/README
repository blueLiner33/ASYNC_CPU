The source code for the DLX. In the ASIC version, both synchronous and
desynchonized versions are present together. The operating mode is
selectable through an external pin (sync_sel).

The CHAIN interconnect is not available in source code. You can find
the netlist present in the synthesis directory.

Two testing scenarios are here:

- In the prelay/ directory you can find a testbench for the prelayout
  phase of the design.

- In the postlay/ directory you can find the testbench after the place
  and route. 


===========================================================================
./synthesis
===========================================================================

Here you can find the necessary files for the synthesis using
Synopsys. 

The library-specific file contents are omitted for copyright reasons.
We have used the Motorola CDR3 0.25 um library.

For more info concerning the synthesis scripts you can refer to the
FAQ.


===========================================================================
./place_and_route
===========================================================================

Here you can find the necessary files for the place and route using
the Cadence SoC Encounter.

The library-specific file contents are omitted for copyright reasons.
We have used the Motorola CDR3 0.25 um library.

The tlf and lef directories are library-specific. The sdc contains the
input constraints and the scripts all the necessary scripts.  For more
info concerning the place and route procedure you can refer to the
FAQ.


===========================================================================
./results
===========================================================================

The output files from the synthesis and p&r are located in the
respective directories.
